OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip planner. It depends on open data in open standard file formats (GTFS and OpenStreetMap), and includes a REST API for journey planning as well as a map-based Javascript client. OpenTripPlanner can also create travel time contour visualizations and compute accessibility indicators for planning and research applications.
